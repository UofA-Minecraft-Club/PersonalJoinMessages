# PersonalJoinMessages
Customise join/leave messages for each player individually

Developed for the University of Alberta Minecraft Club, available for public use

## Usage
- Download the latest jar above (from Releases tab)
- This plugin was tested on Paper 1.21.1
- Install the plugin
- Run the server to generate config files and initialize database
- Use in-game or server console commands to set players' messages (see below)
- Use the config file to:
  - Customize role colors in messages
  - Change when identifier tags should appear (0=never, 1=when username not in message, 2=always)

## Admin Commands
/joinmessage set [username] [message]
 - The message can contain spaces as normal
 - Type the entire message, including the player's username (technically optional)
 - The player's username will be colored with their role color (if found exactly as it appears)
 - Supports Bukkit color codes with \& for ยง

/joinmessage remove [username]
 - removes a user's message

/joinmessage get [username]
 - displays the message to the command sender (not global)

/joinmessage list
 - list of all usernames with a custom message registered

/joinmessage reload
 - reloads the config
 - only needed when changing role colors, NOT customising messages

To customize leave messages, use /leavemessage instead
 - /joinmessage reload and /leavemessage reload do the same thing

## Player Commands
- Requires the joinmessage.self permission node, not granted to anyone by default, use luckperms or similar plugin
- /setjoinmessage [message] and /setleavemessage [message] sets the player's join/leave messages
- Cannot be used by console

## PlaceholderAPI Support
- Requires the joinmessage.placeholders permission for the player who's message it is
- Simply use placeholders in the message and they will be parsed when displayed


### Notes
 - A change in username will require re-doing the custom message
 - Message will be yellow by default, but the color of the entire message or any part can be changed with Bukkit color codes
